## SignUp in React Native
This is the first React Native project I created during/after I completed Stephen Grider's ["Complete React Native and Redux" course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/). It was created as the final project for my 2017 Q2 goal at work to "learn React Native."

### Project
The goal of the app is to consume an API feed from Demco Software's [SignUp](http://demcosoftware.com/products/signup/) event management software. I have plans to complete the "Filter" section of the app to allow real-time customization of the events which are shown.

The app is currently only built for and tested on the iOS simulator.

### Usage
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/thedeany/react-native-signup.git`
2. `cd react-native-signup`
3. Install dependencies via `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. In a second terminal window, run `react-native run-ios`
